## Intermediate Python
### Class 2

---

### Main points

* OOP helps us **organize programs**
* Groups **data (attributes)** and **behavior (methods)** into classes
* Classes are blueprints that create **instances**
* **Inheritance** allows child classes to derive data and behavior of a
    parent class
* `try/except` for handling errors, `raise` for raising errors

---

### Today

* Modules and packages
* Using 3rd-party packages: `pip` and `virtualenv`

---

### "Modularizing"

Breaking big programs into smaller parts

---

### Modularizing

* **Simplicity**: focus on on thing at a time
* **Maintainability**: changing one piece won't break other pieces
* **Reusability**: less copying and pasting!
